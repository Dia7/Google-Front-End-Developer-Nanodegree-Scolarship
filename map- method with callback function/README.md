**Info:**

Array's `map()` method is similar to `forEach()` in that it invokes a callback function for each element in an `array`.

However, `map()` returns a new array based on what's returned from the callback function. 

 *Using map()*

  Using the musicData array and map():
  
    - Return a string for each item in the array in the following format:
      <album-name> by <artist> sold <sales> copies
      
    - Store the returned data in a new albumSalesStrings variable
 
  Note:
    - Do not delete the musicData variable
    - Do not alter any of the musicData content
    - Do not format the sales number; leave it as a long string of digits
